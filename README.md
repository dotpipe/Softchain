# Softchain
Anti-piracy Blockchain

By adapting what information goes into this chain, you can assert whether or not a fully licensed version of software is using an incriminating key.

It is somewhat concealed, the info.

It's a 7bit encryption using up to 64 bits.

The math is something I created myself. It took me awhile to make this and I'm very proud of it. The sockets are very poorly done. I don't know what to do there. But if you can put it into a file, it'll work regardless of where you get it from. Thanks!
